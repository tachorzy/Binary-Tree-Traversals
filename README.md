# Binary-Tree-Traversals
COSC 3320 HW3 Programming Challenge, Professor Wu

Given the pre-order traversal and in-order traversal of a binary tree, output the post-order traversal of the binary tree.

Input format:
line 1: number of nodes
line 2: the pre-order traversal;
line 3: the post-order in-order traversal.
note: The tree nodes are labeled 1, 2, ..., n
